# ml-ops
Hello world!
One of the project which will give you the essence of the necessity of MLOps! I have used the ML concept of Transfer Learning over MobileNet for monkey breed classification! But the fun part is, its automated! You don't have to manually change hyper-parameter. Jenkins job and some basic linux commands will help you change hyper-parameter and give you the best model trained. This is the reason more than 60% of the ML Projects are shut down or not implemented. Using this approach your time and resources are saved moreover it is tested. i have got 94% validation accuracy. Even this was trained on docker container integrating with Jenkins. You can think this as machine has trained ML program. Feel free to share your views and comment!
